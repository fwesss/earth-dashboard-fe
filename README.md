# APIs

## 2️⃣ Authentication API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2️⃣ Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_CONFIRMED_CASES_MAPBOX_STYLE - pulls in styling from a saved
     mapbox map
    *  REACT_APP_CONFIRMED_CASES_MAPBOX_TOKEN - needed to access mapbox api
     to serve maps

# 5️⃣ Content Licenses

🚫For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

 1. `yarn install`
 2. `yarn start`
 
 This repo uses git-secrets to prevent to prevent commiting secrets. After
  installing packages, install and configure git-secrets:
  
## git-secrets Instructions
### Step 1: Install to system
#### *nix (Linux/macOS)

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets
make install
```

#### Windows

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets
PS > ./install.ps1
```

#### Homebrew (for macOS users)

`brew install git-secrets`

### Step 2a (DS): Install githooks

```
cd /path/to/your/repo
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --add '^.*pk\..*$'
git secrets --add '^.*postgres://.*$'
```

AWS tokens will be found by default.

'^.*pk\..*$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with 'pk
.'. This is the basic format of mapbox tokens so those will be found if saved
 anywhere in the repo.
 
'^.*postgres://.*$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with
 'postgres://' which should take care of Postgres URLs. If you're using
  separate variables for host, user, password, and database, then those
   variables will not be detected. Use a URL connection where possible.

### Step 2b (Web): Install githooks

```
cd /path/to/your/repo
git secrets --install -f
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --add '^.*pk\..*$'
git secrets --add '^.*postgres://.*$'
```

AWS tokens will be found by default.

'^.*pk\..*$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with 'pk
.'. This is the basic format of mapbox tokens so those will be found if saved
 anywhere in the repo.
 
'^.*postgres://.*$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with
 'postgres://' which should take care of Postgres URLs. If you're using
  separate variables for host, user, password, and database, then those
   variables will not be detected. Use a URL connection where possible.

### Step 3 (Web): Reinstall husky hooks
Installing the git-secrets hooks will overwrite those installed by husky so
 we need to add those back in.
 
Open /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit and add the following line at the
 bottom of the file:
 `. "$(dirname "$0")/husky.sh"`


## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
    * format - runs prettier against all files not in .gitignore
    * lint - checks for errors in .js files
    * lint:fix - checks for errors in .js files and fixs those that can be
     auto-fixed
    * prettier: runs prettier
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in watch mode
    * test:coverage - runs tests and generates coverage report
    * validate - runs format, lint, build, and test:coverage. Should be run
     prior to submitting pull requests to ensure code adheres to project
      style guidelines, tests pass, and src builds.
