# Project Description

A realtime real world dashboard to teach middle school students the fundamentals of data visualization using real world / realtime earth data pulled and refreshed from a variety of sources.

### Key Features

- Tutorial to show a user the basics on how to properly use the app.
- Multiple lessons for different aspects of planet earth that are interesting and important.
- Interactive data visualization within each lesson that users can manipulate themselves to see the direct changes in the visualizations.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

#### Mapbox

#### D3

#### Redux with Redux Toolkit

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/earth-dashboard-ds) built by DS using Flask and AWS lambda functions

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    * REACT_APP_CONFIRMED_CASES_MAPBOX_STYLE - pulls in styling from a saved mapbox
     map
    * REACT_APP_CONFIRMED_CASES_MAPBOX_STYLE_DARK - Alternative map style
     used in dark mode
    * REACT_APP_CONFIRMED_CASES_MAPBOX_TOKEN - needed to access mapbox api to serve
     maps
    * REACT_APP_TRACKING_ID - ID for Google Analytics

# Testing

- React Testing Library (Integration)
- Jest(Unit)

# Installation Instructions

1.  `yarn install`
2.  `yarn start`
3.  Add .env file to local project. See environment variables above. Variables
    are stored in 1password.

This repo uses git-secrets to prevent to prevent commiting secrets. After
installing packages, install and configure git-secrets:

## git-secrets Instructions

### Step 1: Install to system

#### \*nix (Linux/macOS)

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets
make install
```

#### Windows

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets
PS > ./install.ps1
```

#### Homebrew (for macOS users)

`brew install git-secrets`

### Step 2a (DS): Install githooks

```
cd /path/to/your/repo
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --add '^.*pk\..*$'
git secrets --add '^.*postgres://.*$'
```

AWS tokens will be found by default.

'^._pk\.._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with 'pk
.'. This is the basic format of mapbox tokens so those will be found if saved
anywhere in the repo.

'^._postgres://._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with
'postgres://' which should take care of Postgres URLs. If you're using
separate variables for host, user, password, and database, then those
variables will not be detected. Use a URL connection where possible.

### Step 2b (Web): Install githooks

```
cd /path/to/your/repo
git secrets --install -f
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --add '^.*pk\..*$'
git secrets --add '^.*postgres://.*$'
```

AWS tokens will be found by default.

'^._pk\.._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with 'pk
.'. This is the basic format of mapbox tokens so those will be found if saved
anywhere in the repo.

'^._postgres://._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with
'postgres://' which should take care of Postgres URLs. If you're using
separate variables for host, user, password, and database, then those
variables will not be detected. Use a URL connection where possible.

### Step 3 (Web): Reinstall husky hooks

Installing the git-secrets hooks will overwrite those installed by husky so
we need to add those back in.

Open /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit and add the following line at the
bottom of the file:
`. "$(dirname "$0")/husky.sh"`

## Other Scripts

    * analyze - generate a visualization of the app's bundles and dependencies
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
    * format - runs prettier against all files not in .gitignore
    * lint - checks for errors in .js files
    * lint:fix - checks for errors in .js files and fixs those that can be
     auto-fixed
    * prettier: runs prettier
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in watch mode
    * test:CI - test script that runs on Github action for each push and pull
     request
    * test:coverage - runs tests and generates coverage report
    * validate - runs format, lint, build, and test:coverage. Should be run
     prior to submitting pull requests to ensure code adheres to project
      style guidelines, tests pass, and src builds.
